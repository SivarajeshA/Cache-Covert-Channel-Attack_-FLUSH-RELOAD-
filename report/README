------------About Meetings:------------
1) With Upasana:
>> She suggested us to send more bits at a time.

2) With Saurabh:
>> He suggested us about a better way to find TPR/FPR using a python predefined library - Levenshtein

3) With Biswa:
>> He explained the reason regarding higher latency for the very first time when we access the mapped file.


----------------Taskset:---------------

taskset 0x1 will run the program in core 1
taskset 0x2 will run the program in core 2


--------------Steps to run:------------
1) Task1a
taskset 0x1 ./t1a-sender
tasket 0x2 ./t1a-receiver

2) Task1b
taskset 0x1 ./t1b-sender
tasket 0x2 ./t1b-receiver

3) Task2a
./task-2a [probe_time]
path_to_gpg -d "filename"

4) Task3a
taskset 0x1 ./t3a-sender
tasket 0x2 ./t3a-receiver

-----------------Note:------------------
Threshold
Threshold value is hard coded to 100 in task1a,1b and 3a.
Probe time is hard coded to 3000 in task1a,1b and 3a.
If you want to use calibrated threshold then uncomment the "threshold=getThreshold()" line in the receiver files of task1a,1b and 3a
